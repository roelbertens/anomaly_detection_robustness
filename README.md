# Isolation Forest Robustness

With this package you can generate categorical data that follows the conditional probabilities from a generated 
probability graph. Afterwards anomalies can be inserted in the data. Finally, different scenarios can be simulated
to study the robustness of Isolation Forest to different settings, e.g. number of features. 

## Getting started

Create a python 3 environment with jupyter using `conda env create -f environment.yml` and install this package using 
`pip install .`.

Then open the example notebook to play around.
